# Instructions

So at first, malilito kayo guys ano nangyayare sa buong project. I understand kase magkasama yung "react" pati "java spring boot", andami sobra ng files. 


## Front-end
To start off, sa frontend, all you have to do is write inside the terminal:
```sh
./install.sh    # to install all files from frontend
./run.sh        # to view the frontend design
```

I want you to bear in mind, You can do this

**REACT FOLDER STRUCTURE**<br>
`node_modules` - don't mind this, this is your installed packages<br>
`src` - everything important. This is where you program html/css/js stuff<br>
`src/assets` - all the pictures, videos, and media files that are hidden<br>
`src/pages` - webpages of the website<br>
`src/components` - reusable frontend code <br>
`public` - all the pictures, videos, and media files shown publicly<br>
> leave index.html as it is. Wag niyo galawin :33
<br><br>
## Back-end
For the back-end, yung `java-api` is the backend, all spring boot and java related files are placed there. <br>
If you check the directory: <br> 
`javaapi/src/main/java/com/projectoop/java_api/JavaApiApplication.java` -> dito puwede i-run yung backend
